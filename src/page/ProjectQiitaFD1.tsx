          Hello, I am the representative of ANTI SOCIETY. This time, I wowed the
          audience with my presentation and the fact that I came from
          California, but when I started working on the project, I was a bit of
          a toppin' pooh-pooh. First of all, we decided to make it in Flutter,
          and it took about 12 hours to set up the environment ((I developed an
          allergy to Flutter)). Then I had to finish it in about 4 hours, so it
          may have turned out poorly, but as an idea, and for a student with so
          little development experience... I'm not sure if it was a good idea or
          not... ðŸ™‡ ... So thank you for looking at Qiita. I hope you will also
          check out the Github page as well.

          The current health care system has a serious problem: physicians are
          burdened with excessive paperwork and the need to fill out extensive
          medical records. A significant portion of their time is spent on this
          administrative task, resulting in limited opportunities for direct
          patient care. As a result, the quality of patient care suffers and
          health care professionals struggle to communicate and collaborate
          effectively with one another. Inefficient physician time utilization
          hinders their ability to provide optimal health care services, reduces
          patient satisfaction, and can impair patient outcomes. Solutions are
          needed to streamline administrative tasks, allow physicians to focus
          more on patient care, and facilitate better communication within the
          healthcare ecosystem.

          We therefore propose the implementation of a visual verification
          system as a solution. The goal of this approach is to reduce paperwork
          and streamline processes, allowing physicians to allocate more time to
          direct patient care. The use of visual technology, including
          automation and digitization, simplifies administrative tasks, improves
          efficiency, and facilitates communication among healthcare
          professionals.
